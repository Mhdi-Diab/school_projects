some of my school projects at Ecole 42

## libft
own library of:
- linked list simple and circular (with merge sort)
- binary trees (with red & black balance)
- hashtable dictionary

## linear regression
Introduction to machine learning.
The purpose is to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm
#### How it works:
```
python linear_reg.py
```
(to load the data in Datasets directory)

####options:
- g: to draw a graph representing the data set and the linear regression
- i: to set the number of iterations (default: 1000)
- s: to set the learning rate (default: 0.1)
- p: to print all theta values into a file
- e: to print estimation errors
```
python main.py
```
**type de number of miles the car has travelled**
